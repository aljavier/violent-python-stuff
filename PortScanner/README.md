Simple Python port scanner
=========================

This is a simple python port scanner, very simple.
At the moment I don't remenber too much what I did
change here.

Anyway, I change the optparse lib for the command line
options for argparse, because the first one is deprecated.
Maybe I did add other things, but anyway from the book
like the nmap option for scanning.
