Tools from the book Violent Python
==================================

This repository is just a place when I host some tools/scripts 
made it fron the book Violent Python.

Therefore, most of the tools/scripts here will be different as
they appear in the book, let's say customized, improved, adapted,
but others maybe (I'm not pretty sure, will be just as they appear
there, very, very few or none).

Anyway, the purpose is improved, cutomized as much as posible. Also
good book, you cand buy it on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387387647&sr=8-1&keywords=violent+book "Violent Python").


I use Python 2.7 for all the scripts here.
